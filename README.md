OUR PRODUCT WILL MAINLY BE WORKING WITH CAMERAS INSTALLED IN THE HOUSE WHICH WILL RECOGNISE THE GESTURES DONE BY THE DISABLED PERSON TO PERFORM THE ACTIONS LIKE SWITCHING ON THE LIGHT OR OPENING THE REFRIGERATOR OR EVEN RAISING AN ALARM SO THAT HIS/HER FAMILY CAN BE NOTIFIED. OUR PRODUCT WILL ALSO USE CAMERAS TO PERFORM VARIOUS TYPES OF DETECTIONS LIKE OBJECT DETECTION TO HELP THE BLIND MOVE AROUND THE HOUSE AND ALSO FOOD DETECTION TO CHECK WHETHER THE FOOD AVAILABLE AT THE HOUSE IS EDIBLE OR NOT.

IT WILL ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETECT PEOPLE AT THE DOOR AND USE FACE RECOGNITION TO CHECK FOR KNOWN PEOPLE AND IF IT IS AN UNKNOWN PERSON THEN THE DISABLED PERSONâ€™S FAMILY WILL BE NOTIFIED ABOUT THE UNKNOWN PERSON AT THE DOOR. THIS PRODUCT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN HELPING THE DISABLED FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND OUR WEBAPP CAN ENABLE GUARDIANS TO HAVE AN EYE ON THE USER'S ACTIVITIES
