Smart Home for Disabled People - In a widely populated country like India, almost 5 crore people are suffering from one or the other kind of disability and in most of those houses the disabled people have to stay at home when their family members leave for work.

This is the time that they face most of their problems because their disability does not allow them to do a lot work like for a person on a wheelchair, it would be very hard to move around the house and do all the basic things for themselves, or if it were a blind person then without external assistance they will not be able to move around their houses. To solve this we have come up with our solution “ASSISTME”.

OUR PRODUCT WILL MAINLY BE WORKING WITH CAMERAS INSTALLED IN THE HOUSE WHICH WILL RECOGNISE THE GESTURES DONE BY THE DISABLED PERSON TO PERFORM THE ACTIONS LIKE SWITCHING ON THE LIGHT OR OPENING THE REFRIGERATOR OR EVEN RAISING AN ALARM SO THAT HIS/HER FAMILY CAN BE NOTIFIED. OUR PRODUCT WILL ALSO USE CAMERAS TO PERFORM VARIOUS TYPES OF DETECTIONS LIKE OBJECT DETECTION TO HELP THE BLIND MOVE AROUND THE HOUSE AND ALSO FOOD DETECTION TO CHECK WHETHER THE FOOD AVAILABLE AT THE HOUSE IS EDIBLE OR NOT.

IT WILL ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETECT PEOPLE AT THE DOOR AND USE FACE RECOGNITION TO CHECK FOR KNOWN PEOPLE AND IF IT IS AN UNKNOWN PERSON THEN THE DISABLED PERSON’S FAMILY WILL BE NOTIFIED ABOUT THE UNKNOWN PERSON AT THE DOOR. THIS PRODUCT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN HELPING THE DISABLED FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND OUR WEBAPP CAN ENABLE GUARDIANS TO HAVE AN EYE ON THE USER'S ACTIVITIES
